This workflow is used to generate grating stimuli along with synchronous electrophysiological recordings using the open ephys acquisition board. Grating stimulus parameters are controlled from a csv file. The accompaning python script, gratingParamGen.py, can be used to automatically generate the necessary csv file. The program allows for custom values for spatial frequency, orientation, contrast, etc.
